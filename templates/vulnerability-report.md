**Program:** [Bug Bounty Program Name]  
**URL:** [Program URL]  
**Reported by:** [Your Handle]  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Executive Summary

[One paragraph describing the vulnerability, its impact, and why it matters. Write this for a non-technical audience.]

**Example:**
> The password reset functionality on sso.example.com uses predictable tokens based on timestamps, allowing attackers to reset any user's password without access to their email. This could lead to complete account takeover for all users.

---

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Type
- **CWE:** [CWE-XXX: Name](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/XXX.html)
- **OWASP Category:** [A0X: Category Name](https://owasp.org/Top10/)

### Affected Components
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Endpoint** | `https://target.com/vulnerable-endpoint` |
| **Parameter** | [parameter name or "N/A"] |
| **HTTP Method** | [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc] |
| **Component** | [e.g., "Password Reset Flow", "User Profile API"] |

### Root Cause
[Explain WHY this vulnerability exists. What did the developers miss? What assumption failed?]

**Example:**
> The application generates password reset tokens using the current Unix timestamp concatenated with the user ID. This is predictable because an attacker can guess the approximate time a reset was requested and iterate through possible timestamps.

## Impact Assessment

### What an Attacker Can Do
1. [Specific impact 1 - e.g., "Reset any user's password"]
2. [Specific impact 2 - e.g., "Access other users' private data"]
3. [Specific impact 3 - e.g., "Perform actions as other users"]

### Business Risk
[Describe real-world consequences for the business and users]

**Example:**
> This vulnerability allows complete account takeover for any user. An attacker could:
> - Access private user data
> - Make purchases using stored payment methods
> - Impersonate users for social engineering
> - Delete or modify user accounts
>
> This poses significant reputational and legal risks, especially under GDPR/CCPA for data breaches.

### Affected Users
- [ ] All users
- [ ] Authenticated users only
- [ ] Specific user roles: [which roles?]
- [ ] Single user (self)

### Data at Risk
- [ ] Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- [ ] Financial data
- [ ] Authentication credentials
- [ ] Internal/system data
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## Remediation

### Immediate Fix
[Specific, actionable fix that can be implemented quickly]

**Code Example (if applicable):**
```python
# Vulnerable code (current)
def generate_reset_token(user_id):
    timestamp = int(time.time())
    return f"{user_id}-{timestamp}"

# Secure code (recommended)
import secrets

def generate_reset_token(user_id):
    return secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
```

### Long-term Recommendations
1. [Recommendation 1 - e.g., "Implement cryptographically secure random token generation"]
2. [Recommendation 2 - e.g., "Add rate limiting on password reset endpoints"]
3. [Recommendation 3 - e.g., "Implement token expiration (24 hours)"]

### Verification Steps
[How to verify the fix works]
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
